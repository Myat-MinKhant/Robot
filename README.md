# **AI Chatbot with Voice (Gemini)**  

This is an **AI-powered chatbot** that utilizes **Google's Gemini API** to generate responses based on a given document. It features:  

✅ **Text-based and voice-based interaction**  
✅ **Fast response time**  
✅ **Natural voice output**  
✅ **GUI using CustomTkinter**  

---

## **📌 Features**  
- **Text-based chatbot**: Users can type questions, and the chatbot responds with relevant answers.  
- **Voice-based interaction**: Users can speak to the chatbot, and it will recognize their voice and respond with speech.  
- **Fast & natural speech synthesis**: Uses `pyttsx3` for real-time, smooth, and less robotic speech.  
- **Google Gemini API Integration**: Generates intelligent responses based on an extracted document.  
- **User-friendly GUI**: Built with `CustomTkinter`, featuring a dark mode UI.  
- **Interrupt Speech**: If a user starts a new conversation, the current speech stops immediately.

## **⚙️ How It Works**  
1. **Loads extracted text from a document** (e.g., a PDF-converted text file).  
2. **Uses Gemini API** to generate responses based on the document's content.  
3. **Displays the chatbot's response** in the GUI.  
4. **Uses `pyttsx3` for speech synthesis** (interruptible if a new conversation starts).
